# Megablaster

Virtually circuit-bend a Sega Megadrive/Genesis. Take a perfectly good emulator (DGen), and add a number of "creative" features designed to glitch the video and audio drivers. Results in a number of weird, wonderful, interesting, insane effects. The software equivalent of jamming a screwdriver into a working system while it's running to "see what happens".

## Examples
### Sonic 1


# Build
